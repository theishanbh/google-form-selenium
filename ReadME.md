Import selenium using `pip install selenium`

Approach to solve the problem:

1. We have used Chromedriver version 125.0.0
2. We have created a driver.
3. We have added an argument to Options which allows to open in Chrome in an already logged in user profile
4. We have made a function 'fill_field' that takes arguments 'data' and 'xpath' of the input.
5. Then we have filled the form inputs individually.
6. Prints "Google form submitted successfully"
